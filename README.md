# reading-mzTab-into-R

This repository contains the code and supporting materials for evaluating and demonstrating the import of mzTab files into R. The work is carried out as part of **BioHackathon Europe 2025, Project 14**:

https://github.com/elixir-europe/biohackathon-projects-2025/blob/main/14.md

The analysis is implemented in R, while the user-facing interface is available through the GitHub Pages site:

The GitHub Pages interface presents the rendered evaluation and shows how different mzTab files behave when processed in R.
